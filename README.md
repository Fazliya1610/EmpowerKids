Development of gamified platform on Children's Rights to increase legal literacy and awareness among children in India

Legal literacy and knowing one's rights are vital for fairness and justice in India and worldwide. 
Children aged 8 to 16 often lack to understand their rights.
The "Empowering India's Children" initiative seeks to close this gap by developing a game-based, entertaining platform that not only informs kids about their rights but also gives them the tools they need to stand up for their rights as well as those of others.
The platform's key attributes include interactive gameplay based on real-world situations, modular and adaptive learning modules for personalized learning paths, an accessible and inclusive design, social and community features to promote a sense of empowerment and collaboration, and integration with child rights organizations and support services to give kids access to legal counsel and assistance when they need it. 
With more social justice and equity, this project aims to raise children's legal literacy and awareness in India. 
It attempts to increase children's participation in legal procedures and contribute to more equitable and effective outcomes by empowering them to understand and claim their rights. 
The project's goals, features, problems, and anticipated impact are described in the presentation.
